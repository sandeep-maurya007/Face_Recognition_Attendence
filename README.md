Introduction
Traditional attendance systems often involve manual processes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The Face Recognition-based Attendance System aims to streamline this process by using face recognition algorithms to identify and mark the attendance of individuals.

This project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to recognize faces in images or video streams. It can be applied in various scenarios, such as classrooms, workplaces, and events, where attendance tracking is required.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Automatic attendance recording and reporting.
User-friendly web interface for administrators.
Option to add new individuals to the system.
High accuracy and robustness.
